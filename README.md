# World-Cup-Tweet-Sentiment-Analysis
Machine Learning with Python class at SMU

This project analyzes FIFA World Cup 2022 tweets through using a simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU to train and predict tweet sentiments. This project also uses Keras and TensorFlow.
The different RNN types are assessed through comparing accuracy and loss. In this assessment, LSTM ends up with the highest
peak accuracy rate of 89% and a loss rate of 20%. I also utilized UMAP to visually depict the grouping of positive and negative
sentiment tweets.
